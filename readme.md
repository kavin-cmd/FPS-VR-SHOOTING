Short Description:
made a Shooting Game, where you shoot the red targets for points, and see how many points you can get in 2 minutes,
all while having enemies shoot at you. You can teleport using the inside trigger, and rotate the camera using the joystick for movement.

Problems Encountered:
The player avatar sometimes can clip into the cameraview(mostly fixed), 
Scoreboard for other players would not update(fixed), 
Enemies would not shoot at players(fixed),
